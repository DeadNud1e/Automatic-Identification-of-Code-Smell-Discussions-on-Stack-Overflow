# Automatic-Identification-of-Code-Smell-Discussions-on-Stack-Overflow
Here is a code for the 'Automatic Identification of Code Smell Discussions on Stack Overflow: A Preliminary Investigation' paper.
I suggest using Jupiter Notebook or any other software that support .ipybn files to launch it.
The result of the algorithms may differ at each launch due to the operation of the random number generator. To avoid this, I recommend fixing the seed in all libraries that use random number generation.
Required libraries: numpy, pandas, gensim, scikit learn, ntlk, matplotlib, seaborn, tqdm, re, keras.
